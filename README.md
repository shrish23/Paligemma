# Vision Model Inference with PaliGemma

This repository contains a Python-based project for running inference using the PaliGemma model. The project processes images along with text prompts to generate outputs using a pre-trained model. 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.8 or higher installed on your machine
- Download the repository https://huggingface.co/google/paligemma-3b-pt-224/tree/main for the weights for the model.
- Required Python libraries: Install them by running:
  
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt

## Launch Project

To launch the project run the script on powershell:
./launch_inference.ps1

## Note:
- Change the MODEL_PATH to the directory where the hugging face repository is present.
